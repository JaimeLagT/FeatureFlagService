    # Syntax is "HOST:CONTAINER"
    # We open port 5432 because that's the default port for postgres
    # This allows the local python app to connect to the database inside docker

    #5 Volumes
    # Containers are temporary. If we delete the container, the data is lost.
    # A Volume is a way to persist the data even if the container is deleted
    # where postgres will store its data (/var/lib/postgresql/data)
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
# --- Volumes Definition ---
# We must list any named volumes we used above.
